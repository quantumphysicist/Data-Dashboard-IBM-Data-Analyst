## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I want to show that we can use data analysis to determine which IT skills will be in demand in the future.



## Description <a name="files"></a>

The file `capstone-presentation.pdf` contains a presentation about the demand for IT skills.
Data was collected from GitHub through web-scraping & downloaded from Stack OverFlow.
Data was wrangled using Python, Excel, and IBM Cognos Analytics.


## Findings <a name="findings"></a>

IT skills that will be in demand:
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML/CSS & Python
- Databases: PostreSQL & MongoDB
- Webframes: React.js & Vue.js
- Platforms: Docker & AWS

The online interactive dashboard can be accessed here:

There are three tabs, each containing four panels, that can be interacted with. 
These are fully described in the pdf.
